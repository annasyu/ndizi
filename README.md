We are #TeamNdizi (banana in Swahili).  We are in DC at the DataKind World Bank DataDive on March 16, 2013 scraping food prices from websites around the world.

After scraping crowdsourced banana prices from [here](http://www.humuch.com/prices/Bananas/______/22), we wrote a scraper [here](https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/banana-scraping/) and made the below price visualization by continent.
